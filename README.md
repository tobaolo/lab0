Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

Index.html contains the home page for the site. This page dispalays the nav bar and a picture of me.
About.html contains an about me page. There you can find facts about myself as well as a Bootstrap styled table 
    of the courses I have taken at Harvard.
Dance.html contans videos of me dancing. Here I used bootstrap grid models to style the layout of the page.
Styles.css contains my css for all three html pages.
